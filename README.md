# Maniva Digital AB challenge

The challenge was to go from design to development, given a landing page designed in Figma. We were free to use any frameworks/libraries/tools to build the website. We decided to go with React.

## Challenges

1. Use a design given in Figma => Framework.
	- We had an open choice of which framework to choose from, and we could have gone with any, and decided to dive head in first straight into React. 

2. Desktop + Responsiveness 
	- We created a mobile version, a middle ground for sizes inbetween, and a full fledge desktop version.

3. Creating one React component
	- This challenge was to create ONE component, since we like things to be structured, we planned everything accordingly, and created more than just one.

4. Backend Serve and State Management
	- This challenge was to use state hooks and prepare a fetch request (JSON object). So we went with Axios and fetched some great dad jokes.


### Our Experience

This challenge was a lot of fun, and we went deep into the rabbit hole from start. It gave us come great insight to "problems" that we would never has seen outside of the challenge. From smaller issues, to mind-boggling issues, which made it all worth it at the end when we had our EUREKA moments. The moment of solving an issue, that we never ran into before, is the reason why we study Frontend Dev.
